# Keras Use Cases
Various Python scripts using Keras artificial neural networks to solve deep learning problems, such as image and text classification, regression, and LSTM Text Generation.

## Neural Networks
### Binary Classification with Keras
Implements a movie review classifier using the IMDB dataset that comes packaged with Keras.
<br>
### Multi-Class Classification with Keras
Implements a news classifier using the Reuters dataset that comes packaged with Keras.
<br>
### Regression with Keras
Implements a housing price regression model using the Boston Housing Price dataset that comes packaged with Keras.

## Recurrent Neural Networks
### Text Processing
Transforms text input into tokens and convert those tokens into numeric vectors using one-hot encoding and feature hashing.  Builds basic text-processing models using recurrent neural networks (RNN).  Demonstrates how word embeddings such as Word2Vec can help improve the performance of text-processing models.
