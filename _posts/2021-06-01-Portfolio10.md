## Keras Use Cases
Python scripts using Keras artificial neural networks to solve deep learning problems, such as text classification and price regression.

## Neural Networks
### Binary Classification with Keras
Implements a movie review text classifier with Keras.
<br>
### Multi-Class Classification with Keras
Implements a news text classifier with Keras.
<br>
### Regression with Keras
Implements a housing price regression model with Keras.

## Recurrent Neural Networks
### Text Processing
Transforms text input into tokens and converts those tokens into numeric vectors using one-hot encoding and feature hashing.  Builds basic text-processing and classification models using recurrent neural networks.  Demonstrates how word embeddings such as Word2Vec can help improve the performance of text-processing models.
