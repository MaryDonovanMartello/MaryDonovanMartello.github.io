## Unsupervised Learning for Predicting Credit Card Fraud in R

**Summary**

The goal of this project was to use R to design unsupervised predictive binary classification models to predict whether credit card transactions are fraudulent transactions.  One Class Support Vector Machine and k Means clustering models are highlighted.  The paper and presentation walk through the data understanding and preparation, different models tested, methodology, evaluation and anticipated follow-up steps to the project.

**Models / Methods / Metrics**

* One Class Support Vector Machine 
* K Means Clustering
* Elbow Method
* DBSCAN Clustering
* Logistic Regression
* Support Vector Machine (Two Classes)
* Feature Selection:  
  + Near Zero Variance
  + Learning Vector Quantification
  + Recursive Feature Elimination
  + Boruta
  + LASSO Regression
* ovun.sample (Random Under-Sampling)
* Recall and F1

**Results**

The unsupervised One Class SVM model is a viable model for predicting credit card frauds.  Utilizing the k means clusters as features or labels in supervised models are also viable methods.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

The EDA shows there are distinctions between the fraud records and the non-fraud records.

### Modeling

The unsupervised learning methods I analyzed were One Class Support Vector Machine, k means clustering and DBSCAN clustering.  I compared the results of the unsupervised learning models with supervised classification models.  I tested the k means models with the clusters as input features and as classification labels in supervised models.  In each model, I used a dataset with all the input features except three non-normal features that I dropped.  I also tested each model with only the 5 features identified as the most significant features.

In the unsupervised models, I used the original highly imbalanced proportion of fraud vs non-fraud cases.  However, the imbalance must be addressed in the supervised models used for comparison.  Therefore, I under-sampled the training data for the supervised models.
