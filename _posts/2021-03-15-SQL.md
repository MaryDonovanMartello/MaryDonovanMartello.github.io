## Overview

This is a self-designed project.  The Master's course covered SQL only to a small degree. See the last portion of this Data Preparation project: [here](https://marydonovanmartello.github.io/DataPreparation/){:target="_blank"}.  Therefore, I am self-studying SQL. 

### Data

For this project, I started with an automobile insurance claim dataset that I used for EDA and classification projects: [here](https://marydonovanmartello.github.io/EDAHypoth/){:target="_blank"}  and [here](https://marydonovanmartello.github.io/InsuranceFraud-Python/){:target="_blank"}.  I combined some of the data from this dataset with some new data.  This is my original data:

### Normalize Data

Next, I normalized the data through the fourth normal form by designating primary and foreign keys and separating the data into seven tables.  This is the normalized data:

### Database and Queries

I created a SQLite database with DB Browser.  The following are some queries and results from my auto insurance claim database.
